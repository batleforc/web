                    <h1>A newt?</h1>
                    <p>Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! Shut up! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Why?</p>
                    <p>We found them. We want a shrubbery!! <strong> Did you dress her up like this?</strong> <em> Well, she turned me into a newt.</em> Well, what do you want?</p>
                    <h2>What a strange person.</h2>
                    <p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? The nose? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li><li>Well, what do you want?</li><li>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Be quiet!</h3>
                    <p>Shut up! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. She looks like one. Why? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Burn her!</li><li>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</li><li>Who's that then?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Well, we did do the nose. But you are dressed as one… Burn her! He hasn't got shit all over him. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Shut up! Will you shut up?!</p>
                    <p>Well, I didn't vote for you. But you are dressed as one… Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
                    <p>We found them. What a strange person. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
                    <p>Camelot! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shut up! Who's that then?</p>
                    <p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! I am your king.</p>
                    <p>The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Bloody Peasant! Shut up!</p>
                    <p>Where'd you get the coconuts? Who's that then? Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! I'm not a witch. Well, what do you want? How do you know she is a witch?</p>
                    <p>You don't vote for kings. Well, how'd you become king, then? Why do you think that she is a witch? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!</p>
                    <p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, I didn't vote for you. I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
                    <p>We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Well, we did do the nose. What do you mean?</p>
                    <p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Camelot! He hasn't got shit all over him.</p>
